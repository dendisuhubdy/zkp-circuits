//! Tree aggregation, Task 0 (spec §5, ruling 5): measure before any program is built. One
//! production leaf (`rv32n` over L = 2 real bundle proofs) is proved on the 256 GB droplet. The
//! existing k = 1 self-verifier `rv32r`, with its cap baked, is then run over that leaf proof on
//! the 503 GB droplet: emulated first (the stop rule), then proved under the heap profiler. Every
//! run is logged under `docs/measurements/`. The numbers land in `tests/pins.json`'s
//! `tree_measure` block and `docs/08-tree-aggregation.md` §1–§2. The proving and real-leaf tests are
//! ignored and run on a droplet, one per process; the laptop's emulated-shape count is ignored too
//! (minutes), and so is Task 1a's production step count (`production_rv32t_rows_at_the_emulated_leaf_shape`).
//! Task 2 adds the production depth-2 tree (leaves 1–3, both `rv32t_leaf` steps, the `rv32t_int`
//! root through `verify_tree`, and the per-level genesis values), all ignored, for the 256 GB droplet.
//! Three tests run in-suite, in seconds: the accepting walk against the emulator, the looped walk
//! (`rv32t`'s) against the emulator, and the pinned band against the pinned emulated child.
